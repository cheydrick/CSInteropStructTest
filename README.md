CSInteropStructTest
===================

This is the C source for InteropStructTest.dll, and C# source for CSInteropStructTest.exe

I've been trying to interface C# code with functions in a C .dll and have had some problems. This is a small program that I'm going to use as a reference for getting struct pointers and arrays of structs in/out of a .dll.
